# Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is an open source CSS framework. The main feature of this library is that, unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, it does not provide a series of predefined classes for elements such as buttons or tables.

## Get started with Tailwind CSS

```
npm init
```

```
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer vite
npx tailwindcss init
```

To start the server `npm run start`
